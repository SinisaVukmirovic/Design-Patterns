    <h1>Null Object Pattern</h1>
    <hr>

    <h4>Null Object Pattern is used anytime you have a null object being returned. Checking if something is equal to null before accessing the different properties on that null object.</h4>
    <h4>Idea behind null object pattern is that you create an object that you return instead of null, that has the exact same signature, the same properties and same methods as the object you'd already be returning from that method, and it would just have default values for all these different properties and methods.</h4>
    <h4>A common place where null object patter is used is with user accounts, signing up with an account</h4>
